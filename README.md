# CinemaBookingSystem
C++ Cinema Booking System written in Object Oriented Programming Style.

This C++ Cinema Booking System allows the users to be saved into the system through the .CSV file that will be created upon a new user registration.
It also features an admin function where users can add new movies for display.
Moreover, it also has an auto-update feature where upon booking a seat, the cinema booking interface auto updates the arrangement of the cinema, marking a booking.

The password for the Admin Account is <u><b></b>Admin.</u>
